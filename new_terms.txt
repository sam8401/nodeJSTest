	Anonymous functions:

		execute(function(word){ console.log(word) }, "Hello");
		"We define the function we want to pass to execute right there at the place where execute expects its first parameter. This way, we don’t even need to give the function a name, which
		is why this is called an anonymous function."

	Favicon related information:

		That’s because most browser will try to load the favicon by
		requesting http://localhost:8888/favicon.ico whenever you open
		http://localhost:8888/
